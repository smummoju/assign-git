2. What does fast-forward in Git mean?
A fast-forward is what Git does when you merge or rebase against a branch that is simply ahead of the one you have checked out. check-out happens when you try to pull in changes from another which does not have any conflicts etc. 

3. Why should you have different branches?
Having different branches would help individual developers work in their own space without worrying about the changes on the main branch. Later when a developer wants to merge his changes to main, he would push only his changes to main. 
Having different branches would also ensure that we can track the progress of any particular task which has its own branch. 
Different branches also help us raise different pull requests for every task we want to merge into the main. 
Different branches also help a developer work on different tasks at the same time parallelly without affecting each other. 

4. In a project how many remote Git repositories do you usually have?
There may be one or more than one remote git repository for a project. It comes down to how the team wants to manage the project. 
The team may decide two have separate repositories for both client and server applications or they may choose to have one single repository to house both.
